            My name is Joe. I'm a really cool guy. I've been hanging around this
            planet for about 23 years now, so I've seen a lot. The most valuable
            lesson I've learned in all that time is to be cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're cool, everybody will immediately like you when they meet
            you. It's a surefire way to get ahead of all the uncool schlubs out
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm married to a smokin' hot babe named Britney. We met at a frat
            party in college and hit it off right away. She's everything I need
            in a woman. Even though she can be a bit dull, she's drop-dead
            gorgeous, so it makes up for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a salesman by trade. I sell cars at my uncle's used car lot.
            I've been employee of the month for the past month. It's not my
            dream job, but it pays the bills. Plus, I get to meet all kinds of
            schlubs all day, so it stays interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, that's about all you need to know about me. What are you, a
            government spy?

            Frickin' shlub.
